This assignment involves analyzing a dataset containing messages labeled as either "spam" or "legitimate." The task is to apply machine learning techniques to predict whether a given message is spam or not, using two different models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The steps include loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame, creating the label set (y) from the "spam" column and the feature set (X) from the remaining columns, and checking the balance of the labels. The data is then split into training and testing datasets using train_test_split, and feature scaling is performed using StandardScaler. After preprocessing, a Logistic Regression model and a Random Forest model are built and evaluated for accuracy. The performance of both models is compared, and the better-performing model is discussed. The notebook is assessed based on the implementation of data splitting, scaling, model creation, prediction, and performance evaluation, with specific points for each step.
